The Center for the Integration of IDEA Data (CIID) developed the Generate application to improve data quality and simplify ED_Facts_ reporting for state education agencies (SEAs). Generate standardizes data, improves data use and reporting, and supports administrative and policy work to improve educational outcomes for all students and their families. The functionality for each of the reporting capabilities described in this guide is consistent across the various reporting options. Generate has the capability to produce reports for all ED_Facts_ files. It also includes a Data Population Summary report that provides a high-level summary of data within Generate, SPP/APR reports that provide the data needed to calculate selected indicators, and a Reports Library that includes student level data summary reports for exiting, graduation, participation in federal programs, proficiency rates, and educational environment.

Generate includes all ED_Facts_ reports, 4 State Performance Plan/Annual Performance (SPP/APR) reports, and 15 additional student level data summaries within the Reports Library.

1. Indicator 4A – Suspension/Expulsion

# Generate Help

CIID defines sustainability as the continued intended operation of a system over time despite internal and external changes in areas such as personnel, leadership, finance, and technical infrastructure.​&#x20;

Additionally, sustainability requires that the system remains relevant for stakeholders by expanding to meet their current and future needs. This may mean that the occasional technical question about Generate and need for support may arise. When that happens, we invite you to Contact Generate Help!&#x20;

### What is Generate Help?&#x20;

Generate help is the Generate Team’s ongoing support resource for states that have previously had direct support from CIID Technical Assistance providers. &#x20;

### How do I utilize Generate Help?&#x20;

If a Generate question or need arises email [GenerateHelp@aemcorp.com](mailto:GenerateHelp@aemcorp.com) with the following information:&#x20;

* Contact information (email and phone number) for SEA member(s) that should be responded to&#x20;
* The exact SEA question and/or if an issue: what is currently happening and what did the SEA expect to have happen with Generate/the data. Include screenshots if appropriate.&#x20;
* Resolution needed by date/time&#x20;
* Context for any related issues/items and any additional details&#x20;

### Response Process&#x20;

During business hours, you will receive a prompt reply to confirm that CIID has received your request. &#x20;

The CIID Tester will review the question and identify resources to respond to the question. As necessary, technical tickets will be created and assigned on the next business day. The internal assignee will respond to the SEA with any questions and confirm the request and the estimated timing for a resolution. Once a solution is provided, the ticket will be closed, and documents will be updated as necessary once the SEA confirms the solution. &#x20;

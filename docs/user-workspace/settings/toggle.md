# Toggle

The Toggle settings collect supplementary metadata and information from the state education agency about data collection. This information determines what will display on reports. Note: if the toggles related to the IDEA ED_Facts_ files do not match the information you provided the Partner Support Center (PSC) when completing your IDEA State Supplemental Survey, it could result in unexpected format or validation errors in the ED_Facts_ Submission System (ESS) when you submit the Generate-produced IDEA ED_Facts_ files.

The “Assessments Toggle” works differently than the other Toggle options and is accessed from a link on the main Toggle page. For information about the Assessments toggle, see [Toggle | Assessments](toggle.md#\_toc113439071).

The information below explains how to use the various options within Toggle. To ensure the accuracy of the reports:

* Set Toggle settings before running reports.
* Set Toggle settings before running the Data Store migrations (see Data Store).

To access Toggle, click on “Settings” then click “Toggle” from the submenu that displays.

Note that the reference period dates disappeared when Toggle was switched to Yes. If you Toggle to Yes, then Toggle back to No, the dates will display again. Change the date entries to match the collection schedule for your state.

To change a date field, follow the steps below.

1. Manually type the date into the field. This overrides the default date.
2. Click on the dropdown arrow next to the date field to display an interactive calendar.

When selecting Toggle options, pay attention to changes that occur based on your selections. For example, changing a Toggle setting from “No” to “Yes” may result in another field displaying where additional actions are necessary. In the example below, the Toggle has been changed from “No” to “Yes” resulting in a response required by the user.

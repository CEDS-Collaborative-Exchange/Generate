# Update

{% hint style="info" %}
Generate version 3.1 introduced auto-update functionality. This feature is not available in versions prior to 3.1.
{% endhint %}

From the Update Generate page, you can update Generate to the most recent version. Each version that is available will display on the page. Updates will remain available indefinitely on the Update Generate page until they are processed.

To check for available updates in Generate:

1. Click on Settings
2. Click on Update

### Update Generate <a href="#update_generate" id="update_generate"></a>

Updates that are available for download display in chronological order, must be run in chronological order and can only be applied one at a time. This means that if multiple updates are pending, _**only the next version should be downloaded**._ For example, if an SEA is running Generate 3.5 and wants to update to Generate 3.8, the SEA must update to version 3.6, then 3.7, before updating to 3.8.

If updates are not available, the “Update Generate” page will display the following message:

If updates are available, they will display on the page below the header “Available to Download.” The page includes the version number, the date the version was released, a short description of what is included in the update, suggestions for backing up the database prior to running the update, and a link to the Release Notes.

1. Click on the VIEW button below the Release Notes column to view the release notes.
   1. The Release Notes will open to their location on CIID’s website as a new page in your browser.

> **Downloaded and Ready to Apply:** Automatically displays the oldest version first which must be run **before** any other versions can be processed.

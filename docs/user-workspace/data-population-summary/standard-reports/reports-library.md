# Reports Library

The Reports Library includes student level data summary reports developed by stakeholders. These reports include data on exiting, participation in federal programs, proficiency rates, and educational outcomes. The Reports Library is

available to all users. It is unique in that it allows you to categorize reports by topic, giving you the ability to customize how you search for reports.

The Reports Library is accessible from the top menu bar on any page in Generate, as well as from the shortcut menu on the Generate Home page.

The following information describes how to access, categorize, run, and view reports in the Reports Library.

## Accessing Reports Library <a href="#accessing_reports_library" id="accessing_reports_library"></a>

## Categorizing Reports <a href="#categorizing_reports" id="categorizing_reports"></a>

Reports for the Reports Library are categorized by Report Topic and can be customized according to user preference. You can create new report topics, add reports to existing report topics, and remove reports from existing report topics. Modifications to the page are personalized for the user that is logged in; changes made by one user cannot be seen by another.

The steps below explain how to customize the Reports Library.

## Creating Report Topics <a href="#creating_report_topics" id="creating_report_topics"></a>

By default, the main page displays a list of all the reports available in the Reports Library as shown below.

# Creating Submission Files

Generate creates the submission files for ED_Facts_ reports in the file types accepted by the ED_Facts_ Submission System (ESS). Only file types accepted by ESS will appear for selection.

Currently, accepted file types are:

* Tab Delimited (.tab)
* Comma Delimited (.csv)
* Fixed (.txt)
* Beginning in 2016-17, ESS stopped accepting the .XML file type. Beginning with 2016-17 forward, Generate does not display that file type as an option. For years prior to 2016-17, the .XML file type does display as an option.

Use the dropdown list under CREATE SUBMISSION FILE to see the available formats, as shown below.

Note: Opening .csv or. tab files in Excel can cause leading zeros to drop from the file. To view the submission file in these formats consider creating a copy of the file and opening the copy instead.

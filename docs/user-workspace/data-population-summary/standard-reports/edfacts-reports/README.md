# EDFacts Reports

## Overview

To date, all [ED_Facts_](https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/index.html) reports can be produced in Generate. Each report is displayed in a user-friendly format that allows you to review the data online or via an export before you create final submission files in the ED_Facts_ file format. Exporting reports lets you share them with data stewards, data managers, or others who are responsible for the data. Each report has a corresponding CEDS Connection that identifies the required data elements and how those elements should be used to create the report. There is also a link to the ED_Facts_ file specifications page where you can quickly access the file specification for each report.

The processes to produce and use the ED_Facts_ reports, including how to create the submission files, are described below.

### **To access the ED**_**Facts**_** report page**:

1. Click on the words Standard Reports from the toolbar at the top of any page in Generate
2. From the dropdown list, select EDFacts Reports.

## Generating ED_Facts_ Reports <a href="#generating_edfacts_reports" id="generating_edfacts_reports"></a>

The following describes the layout of the ED_Facts_ reports page and explains how to select the various report options.

### Report Options <a href="#toc113439047" id="toc113439047"></a>

Each report includes the following selection fields for displaying the data. The report will update as each option is selected.

* [Level](./#level)
* [Year](./#year)
* [Category Set](./#category-set)
* [Report](./#viewing\_edfacts\_reports)

### Level

There are three report levels (SEA, LEA, and School), for which ED_Facts_ reports can be generated. The availability of each report level is based on guidance found in the file specification for that report. For example, if you select C002 (Child Count), you will see Levels for SEA, LEAS, and SCHOOLS because the ED_Facts_ file specification requires reporting at all three levels. If you select C007 (Children with Disabilities (IDEA) Reasons for Unilateral Removal), you will only see Levels for SEA and LEAS because only SEA and LEA levels are required for reporting.

To select the Level, click on the corresponding button. The SEA level is selected below.

Once selected, the report will run based on this selection.

### Year

The Year field represents the available years for which the data are being reported. The year selection will coincide with the data for the school years that exist in the Generate Integrated Data Store (IDS). For example, if the data for school year 2021 has not been added to the IDS (meaning the migrations for 2021 data have not been run), there won’t be data for that school year in the report. If you select a year that doesn’t have data and run the report, a message will display that says, “**No records to Display**” at the bottom left side of the page as shown below.

Once selected, the report will run based on this selection.

### Category Set

Category sets will differ for each ED_Facts_ report and are specific to the guidance found in the file specification. When a category set is selected by the user, the page will run the report based on the permitted values for that specific category, including a subtotal and/or total of the education unit if required by the ED_Facts_ file specification. Using C002 as an example, when the user selects Category Set C, the report displays data aggregated by _Racial Ethnic_ and by _Education Environment (IDEA) SA._ Screenshots showing both the 2021 ED_Facts_ file specification and Generate report are shown below, respectively.

## Viewing ED_Facts_ Reports <a href="#viewing_edfacts_reports" id="viewing_edfacts_reports"></a>

The layout for each ED_Facts_ report is the same. The report page for C005 is shown below. Instructional text appears at the top of the page, and a warning about the data containing small “_n_” sizes is included above each report title. The warning states, “_Reports that are created by Generate are intended for internal use by SEA officials. They may contain small cell sizes and should not be released to the public prior to review by your state’s disclosure review board. Some amount of disclosure avoidance may be required before this report is ready for public consumption._” For this reason, **use caution** when sharing these reports with others.

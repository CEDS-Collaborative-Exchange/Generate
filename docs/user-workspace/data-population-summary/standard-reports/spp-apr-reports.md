# SPP/APR Reports

## SPP/APR REPORTS <a href="#spp-apr_reports" id="spp-apr_reports"></a>

The State Performance Plans/Annual Performance Reports (SPP/APR) include indicators that measure child and family outcomes and compliance with IDEA requirements. To date, there are four (4) SPP/APR reports in Generate. Each report is displayed online in a user-friendly format that provides the data needed to do the SPP/APR calculations.

Reports can be exported as Excel files and shared with data stewards or others responsible for reviewing the quality of the data. Each report has a corresponding CEDS Connection that identifies the data elements required to run the report and the analysis for using and aggregating the elements. There is also a link to the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) [SPP/APR Resources page.](https://osep.communities.ed.gov/#program)

The process to access, run and view reports is described below.

The SPP/APR Reports page is also available as a shortcut in the center of the Home page (not shown).

#### Report Options <a href="#report_options" id="report_options"></a>

There are several options available for the report. You can filter the report by LEA Name or LEA ID, export the report to Excel and share it with others for review and quality assurance activities, or select links that provide additional information to support your review such as the CEDS Connection and the SPP/APR Collection Tool.

The following describes the layout of the SPP/APR Reports page and explains how to use the various report options to run the report.

#### Running Reports <a href="#toc113439056" id="toc113439056"></a>

Each report includes the following selection fields for displaying the data. Note that each time a new field selection is made, the report will automatically update based on your selection.

* [Report](spp-apr-reports.md#report)
* [Year](spp-apr-reports.md#year)
* [Level](spp-apr-reports.md#level)
* [Category Set](spp-apr-reports.md#category-set)

Once selected, the report will run again based on your selection.

#### **Report**

The reports available are listed in the dropdown box under Report. To run a specific report:

1. Click on the dropdown arrow below the Report field.
2. Click on a report name to select it.

Once selected, the report will run. To change to a different report, select a different report name from the Report filter. The new report will display.

#### Year

The Year field represents the available years for which the data are being reported. The year selection will coincide with the data for the school years that exist in the ODS. For example, if the data for school year 2013-14 has not been added to the ODS (the migration of 2013-14 data has not been run), there won’t be data for that school year in the report. If you select a year that doesn’t have data and run the report, a message will display that says, “No records to Display” at the bottom left side of the page as shown below.

#### Level

There are two Levels (SEA, LEA) for which SPP/APR reports can be generated. Levels are predetermined for each report and are based on OSEP’s guidance for reporting. For example, Indicators 4A and 4B are only reportable at the LEA level so Generate will only display an option of LEA for those reports. Indicators 9 and 10, however, require reporting at both the SEA and LEA levels, so both options will be available if you choose those reports.

1. Click on the corresponding button to select the Level.&#x20;

The SEA level is being selected below.

#### Category Set

Category sets will differ for each SPP/APR report. When a category set is selected by the user, the page will run the report based on that specific category as per OSEP’s guidance for the SPP/APR reports.

To select a Category, follow the steps below.

1. Click on the dropdown arrow below the Category Set field.
2. Click on a Category Name.

The category set for American Indian or Alaskan Native is being selected below.

Once selected, the report will run.

Each SPP/APR report layout is the same for each report. Each report includes instructional text that appears at the top of the page, a warning about the data containing small “_n_” sizes is included above each report title, e.g., “_Reports that are created by Generate are intended for internal use by SEA officials. They may contain small cell sizes and should not be released to the public prior to review by your state’s disclosure review board. Some amount of disclosure avoidance may be required before this report is ready for public consumption,_” a title that matches the name of the SPP/APR Indicator, and a subtitle that pertains to the category set.

Note: because reports can contain small cell sizes, **use caution** when sharing these reports with others.&#x20;

The report page for Indicator 4A is shown below.

There are several options available for the report. You can filter the report by LEA Name or LEA ID, export the report to Excel, or select links to other resources.

Each report has a filter field that allows you to select a specific LEA. The filter supports characters and numbers, so you can search by name or identifier.

To filter for a specific LEA or School, follow the steps below.

1. Click inside the Filter field.
2. Enter at least two characters in the field OR enter part of the identifier.
3. The system will return the data based on your selection.
4. To clear the filter, delete the information from the field.

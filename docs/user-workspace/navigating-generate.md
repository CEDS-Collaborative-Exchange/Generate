* The timeout clock starts to count down as soon as you log into Generate.
* When the timeout clock reaches five minutes, the following notification will display:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (27).png" alt="Idle warning message that reads, You are Idle. Your session will timeout in 5 minutes. To avoid being logged out of Generate, click the Ok button."><figcaption><p>Idle warning message</p></figcaption></figure>

* To reset the timeout clock, move the mouse.
* If the system times out, you will see the following message:

![System time out message that reads, "You have been Logged Out. You have been logged out due to inactivity."](<../.gitbook/assets/image (140).png>)



You will need to log back in to Generate. Once you have logged in, a notification message will display that says your previous session has been found. To navigate to the place, you were before the system timed out, click “Yes.” To return to the Home page, click “No.” Note: whether the system logged you out because you were idle, or you intentionally logged out of the system, the “Previous Session Found” message will display.

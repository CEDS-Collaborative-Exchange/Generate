# User Roles

## User Roles

There are two types of user roles in Generate: Reviewer and Administrator. The SEA determines the process for establishing user accounts and assigning Generate roles to individuals via Active Directory services. Active Directory is a function of the state’s operating system and is not included with the CIID installation.

The functions you can perform in Generate depend on the user role to which you are assigned:

### Reviewer Role

As a Generate Reviewer, you will have access to all features and functionality described within this document, including the Toggle feature in [Settings](settings/). Generate Reviewers do not have access to the Generate Data Store in Settings. Generate Reviewers are typically program personnel such as ED_Facts_ Coordinators, Data Managers, Data Stewards, or other staff responsible for the data and for running and reviewing reports and confirming record counts.

### Administrator Role

As a Generate Administrator, you will have access to the same features and functionality as the Generate Reviewer. The difference is that Administrators can also access the Data Store in Settings. The Data Store provides the interface for moving the data from the state’s longitudinal data system, or another source, into the Generate Operational Data Store (ODS), and the Reporting Data Store (RDS). The Administrator role is typically assigned to technical staff with a knowledge of the state’s source systems and Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes. For example, the Administrator role might be assigned to a Database Administrator, or someone responsible for processing and submitting the ED_Facts_ files through the ED_Facts_ Submission System (ESS). Anyone with the applicable knowledge and skills can be assigned to this role.

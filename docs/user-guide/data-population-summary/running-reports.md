# Running Reports

Each report has a filter field that limits the number of records returned or lets you view a certain SEA, LEA, or school. The filter option allows the entry of characters or numbers, so you can search by name or ID.

To filter for a specific SEA, LEA, or school:

1. Click inside the Filter field.
2. Enter at least two characters of the SEA, LEA, or School Name in the filter field, OR enter part of the LEA ID or School ID.
3. The system will return the data based on your selection.
4. To clear the filter field, delete the entries.

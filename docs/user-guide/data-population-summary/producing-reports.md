# Producing Reports

## Report Options <a href="#toc113439042" id="toc113439042"></a>

You can filter reports by various options, such as **Report**, **Year**, and **Level**. You can filter the reports by local education agencies (LEAs) or schools, and you can export the reports to share with others. Each online report can be sorted in ascending or descending order by clicking on a column header. The report will automatically update and display data as the various query options are selected.

The following sections describe how to run and use each report in the Data Population Summary.

### **Level**

You can run the Data Population Summary reports by SEA, LEA, or school level as shown below:

### **Year**

The Data Population Summary Home page defaults to the most recent year. The dropdown menu is based on data in the DimDates database table. The data within that table drive the years that are displayed on the dropdown list.

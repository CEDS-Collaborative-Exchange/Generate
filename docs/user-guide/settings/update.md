# Update

{% hint style="info" %}
Generate has auto-update functionality that can be done from the Generate application. We know that in some cases states may not be able to update from the application and need an alternative. Most of these alternatives will need technical staff to perform the Generate system upgrade. We have a list of alternative ways to update generate here.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

\*need to add who has access to this functionality.

\*add how they are notified about updates and the link to the release schedule and how to join office hours.

From the Update Generate page, you can update Generate to the most recent version. Each version that is available will display on the page. Updates will remain available indefinitely on the Update Generate page until they are processed.

To check for available updates in Generate:

1. Click on Settings
2. Click on Update

### Update Generate <a href="#update_generate" id="update_generate"></a>

Updates that are available for download display in chronological order, must be run in chronological order and can only be applied one at a time. This means that if multiple updates are pending, _**only the next version should be**_

_**downloaded**._ For example, if an SEA is running Generate 11.1 and wants to update to Generate 12.0, the SEA must update to version 11.2, then 11.3, before updating to 12.0.

If updates are not available, the “Update Generate” page will display the following message:

If updates are available, they will display on the page below the header “Available to Download.” The page includes the version number, the date the version was released, a short description of what is included in the update, suggestions for backing up the database prior to running the update, and a link to the Release Notes.

# Step 1: Define Goals for Integration

## Define Goals for Integration

Define Goals for Integration In Step 1, state education agency (SEA) project teams will articulate the need for the&#x20;IDEA Part B data integration project and set corresponding goals, evaluate existing data integration processes,&#x20;define the scope of the project, and begin documenting the data systems that will be affected. These tasks&#x20;create a shared vision for data integration within the SEA and help identify necessary resources.

### Why Complete Step 1?

Developing a common understanding of the project and articulating what it will and will not accomplish helps&#x20;create buy-in and set expectations. The documents created in this step (e.g., the use case, self-assessment, data&#x20;system architecture, and scope document) serve as planning and communication tools that can be used to&#x20;promote the project within the SEA, onboard new staff, set boundaries, and answer questions that arise.

### Process and Timing

Tasks in Step 1 of the toolkit can be completed in a two-day meeting or across a series of shorter in-person or&#x20;virtual meetings. Each task will take 1 to 3 hours to complete. However, the tasks contain several interdependent&#x20;activities, so project teams should review each document to ensure coherence with those completed previously.

Following initial meetings to draft the documents, each team member should review them to confirm\
agreement or offer feedback before presenting them to SEA leadership. The project team should update these&#x20;materials as needed based on feedback from leadership or changes in the scope of the project. The data&#x20;integration self-assessment can also be repeated after the project is complete to show progress and identify&#x20;ongoing needs.

### Task 1.1: Develop a Draft Use Case

The use case describes the goal of data integration. It articulates the impact and benefits in general terms and&#x20;creates a common understanding of the problem or need that data integration will address. Clearly identifying&#x20;the goals for data integration can help build support within your SEA for the integration effort.

#### Activity 1.1.1 Complete Use Case Template

Developing the use case and the expected outcomes of data integration will:

* improve support for the project by demonstrating the benefits of data integration to critical stakeholders  &#x20;within the SEA;
* establish the general scope for the project and inform the development of an integration plan; and
* provide the project team with an initial list of stakeholders to support the project.

Short use case documents can be beneficial for creating buy-in with particular groups of stakeholders, and for&#x20;routine department tasks like onboarding new staff.

The Use Case Template can be used to guide a core group of associated staff to:

* establish data integration needs;
* determine which data will be required;
* identify stakeholders, their data access and the ways the project will impact their work; and document timing  &#x20;and risks.

The resulting use case demonstrates the impact that integration will have at a high-level and assists with&#x20;building support within the SEA.

#### **Activity 1.1.2:** Present draft use case to stakeholders and modify as necessary

Once you have a draft use case, the next activity is presenting it to stakeholders within the SEA and finally to&#x20;SEA leadership for approval. Presenting the draft use case to a broad coalition of people can help to create&#x20;momentum, secure cooperation, and build the vision required to move forward.

Stakeholders in the SEA may include:

* Special Education Director
* Part B Data Manager
* EDFacts Coordinator
* SLDS Staff
* Data Governance Coordinator
* Information Technology (IT) Staff
* Data Stewards or Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)

Once stakeholders are identified, schedule one or more in-person meetings to present and explain the goals&#x20;and expected benefits of data integration. If in-person meetings are not feasible, accomplish this less formally&#x20;through an email solicitation and document review process. Revise the use case based on feedback from the&#x20;stakeholders and share revisions with stakeholders for approval before presenting it to SEA leadership. The result&#x20;should be a common understanding and support from stakeholders and leadership.

Once your draft is final, schedule time with SEA leadership to present and explain the use case, gain support&#x20;and, if required, formal approval to proceed with data integration efforts. Leadership support is often necessary&#x20;to make staff available for the project as tasks proceed. If possible, include informed advocates and stakeholders&#x20;in the meeting and have them explain their need for the data integration project. Their involvement is most&#x20;effective when leadership views them as an important voice. Revise the draft use case based on feedback&#x20;received from SEA leadership and share revisions with stakeholders for approval before sharing with leadership&#x20;for final approval, if necessary.

As the data integration project progresses, keep SEA leadership apprised of progress to maintain awareness of&#x20;the project’s value. If leadership changes, present the use case to the new leaders to inform them of the project’s purpose, answer questions, learn their priorities, and garner support.

### Task 1.2: Assess system architecture and readiness for the data integration&#xD; project

The activities in Task 1.2 are to complete a data integration self-assessment and document the SEA’s data system&#x20;architecture. These exercises help project teams develop a common understanding of the SEA’s data system,&#x20;processes, and needs. This task sets the stage for a clear scope of work; approvals and resources needed; and&#x20;arrangements to begin work.

Discoveries or decisions made during these activities may prompt you to revise the use case, and you may&#x20;choose to complete the activities in a different order depending on the situation in your SEA.

#### Activity 1.2.1: Assess the current data integration environment&#x20;

The CIID IDEA Part B Data Framework Self-Assessment is an Excel worksheet in which SEA staff can assess the&#x20;current environment to support data integration, including tabs for:

* data governance policies and procedures;
* communication processes;
* current alignment of data to be integrated; and
* staff resources available to support data integration.

We recommend that SEAs complete the self-assessment after at least one draft of the use case has been&#x20;reviewed by stakeholders, since the two activities are closely related.

Completing the self-assessment and discussing each indicator allows project teams to document their current&#x20;data governance policies and progress toward integration. Through that activity, teams may identify areas of&#x20;strength and areas where they may need to focus extra attention to build a firm data governance structure.

Weaknesses identified in the self-assessment may be added to the scope document. For example, the data&#x20;sources that are undocumented or duplicative could be resolved as part of the data integration project.

#### Activity 1.2.2 Document data system architecture&#x20;

This activity involves creating a diagram of the SEA’s data system architecture to show data sources and their&#x20;interconnections. The diagram will help ensure that all members of the project team understand the structure of&#x20;the data system, define the data integration project, and identify components of the data system that may need&#x20;adjustment.&#x20;

An example of a data system architecture diagram is provided below:\
As the team develops the diagram of their data system architecture, here are some questions and\
considerations:

* What are the sources for the IDEA EDFacts files and where are they stored?
* Are there any impediments to accessing unit-level (i.e., student, staff) data?
* How and when does the SEA currently collect, verify, aggregate, and report EDFacts data?
* Are there plans underway for system modernization? If so, consider creating a diagram for the current system  &#x20;and future system.

As the team maps out the disgram, consider the following:&#x20;

* Are there any trouble spots in the system?&#x20;
* What are points of risk for data quality?
* Are there areas where data are duplicated?
* What parts of the system may be affected by the data integration project?
* What changes will need to wait until the integration project is complete?

### Task 1.3: Confirm scope and secure SEA resources&#x20;

The activities in Task 1.3 are to confirm the scope of work on the data integration project and secure SEA&#x20;resources needed for that work. The scope document for the data integration project takes the goals and&#x20;questions presented in the use case, frames them within the current SEA environment, and further defines&#x20;the work of the project. It also defines the limits of the project. The scope document supports a common&#x20;understanding of the project parameters and expectations, and serves as a management tool to ensure goals&#x20;are met.

This task also sets the stage for acquiring necessary resources, obtaining approvals, and preparing to begin&#x20;work. It can serve as the foundation for the project management plan, resource allocation, budgeting, and&#x20;prioritization of the work.

#### Activity 1.3.1: Define scope of the data integration project.&#x20;

Based on the goals of integration and use case identified in Step 1.1, develop a scope document that defines the&#x20;extent and limits of the project and can guide the&#x20;project’s evaluation by offering a set of objectives&#x20;against which the project can be measured.&#x20;The CIID Data Integration & Technical Assistance&#x20;Scope Tool is a resource SEAs can use to&#x20;document project scope and includes sections for defining:&#x20;

* IDEA Part B EDFacts files to be submitted through Generate;
* objectives and projected timelines to submit EDFacts files through Generate;
* takeaways from the CIID IDEA Part B Data Framework Self-Assessment and data systems architecture  &#x20;activities;
* resources that will be provided by the SEA and CIID; and
* scope exclusions.

Document decisions about the scope and the reasoning behind those decisions so if the composition of the&#x20;project team changes, the same issues will not need to be revisited.

For scope exclusions, identify what is outside of the bounds of the project. Exclusions may refer to data or&#x20;reporting needs that will not be addressed by the integration project. Develop a “parking lot” of issues that&#x20;are out of scope. The “parking lot” may also capture ideas for future enhancements, or additions to the data&#x20;integration project for consideration in a future phase.

#### **Activity 1.3.2: Secure SEA approval for integration project**&#x20;

Set a meeting with SEA leadership and follow SEA protocols for confirming access to resources. At a minimum,&#x20;secure approval from the Chief Information Officer or Technology Leaders, EDFacts Coordinator, and the Director&#x20;of Special Education.

**Items to discuss:**&#x20;

* Use case and scope
* Staff availability and allocation of staff time
* Necessary costs associated with this project

Transparency and clarity around the amount of work needed to complete the integration project and\
the estimated length of time required will ensure ongoing support from leadership and help to avoid\
misunderstandings.

# Overview

### Purpose of the CIID Toolkit

The CIID Data Integration Toolkit contains action-oriented steps and corresponding resources to help State&#x20;Education Agencies (SEAs) and technical assistance (TA) providers integrate their IDEA Part B data with their&#x20;State Longitudinal Data Systems (SLDSs) using the Common Education Data Standards (CEDS). The Toolkit&#x20;provides a road map of typical steps and tasks required for successful data integration using CEDS; it draws&#x20;directly from state experiences and reflects current data management best practices. The Toolkit provides&#x20;instructions for project managers and IT staff as they prepare for, complete, and sustain data integration projects.

### Who Should Use the Toolkit?

Users of the Toolkit may include:

*  State Special Education Directors
* &#x20;Data Governance Coordinators
* Part B Data Managers
* IT Staff
* EDFacts Coordinators
* Data Stewards SLDS Staff

It is important for members of SEA data integration teams to review the Toolkit steps and identify the\
responsible team member(s) based on the state needs and staff responsibilities.\
The roles and responsibilities for each position vary widely by state, depending on the size of the department,&#x20;whether the IT department is integrated into the SEA or belongs to a separate agency, and the structure of&#x20;the agency. This toolkit refers to data stewards and subject matter experts (SMEs) according to the following&#x20;general definitions:

* the data steward works directly with data, understands business rules, and has familiarity with data quality  &#x20;requirements.
* the SME has a deep knowledge of the program requirements and needed business rules as well as a firm  &#x20;grasp of the data.
* Part B data managers, EDFacts Coordinators, or other staff may serve as a data steward, the SME or both,  &#x20;depending on their role and the task at hand.

Project teams can use the Toolkit to plan and support integration efforts in their SEAs in collaboration with CIID&#x20;TA providers or on their own in collaboration with their colleagues. To access additional integration resources or&#x20;receive TA from CIID, contact CIIDTA@aemcorp.com or visit CIIDTA.org.

### How to Use the Toolkit

This toolkit outlines the major steps and supporting tasks required to complete any data integration project.

Each task description details&#x20;

* [ ] **Step 1.** Define goals for integration&#x20;
* [ ] **Step 2.** Establish structured documentation and project plan for data integration work
* [ ] **Step 3.** Organize data elements for integration and document it using CEDS
* [ ] **Step 4.** Implement and perform extract, transform and load (ETL) procedures
* [ ] **Step 5.** Review and validate sustainable data integration process

The steps of this toolkit are not limited to data integration; the toolkit can also serve as a general project\
management tool. The artifacts produced while completing the steps support data governance structures&#x20;that can be expanded beyond IDEA data and establishes strong data governance principles and sustainable&#x20;practices.

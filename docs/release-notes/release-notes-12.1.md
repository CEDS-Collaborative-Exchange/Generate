# Release Notes 12.1

Release Overview

Generate version 12.1 focuses on EDPass submissions due **January 8, 2025**, specifically enhancing reporting and compatibility for assessment files **FS175**, **FS178**, **FS179**, **FS185**, **FS188**, and **FS189**. Key upgrades include .NET framework updates, streamlined data processing, and expanded test capabilities.

### Required State Changes

#### ðŸš¨ Important .NET update

In Generate 12.1, weâ€™re updating the .NET Core runtime from version 6.0 to 8.0, as support for 6.0 is ending. Use the link below to download the compatible [**ASP.NET Core Runtime 8.0.10**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) version for your environment.

{% hint style="info" %}
NOTE: The server can support multiple versions of .NET at the same time so you can install the newer version prior to upgrading and without removing older versions.

#### Assessments

We added the ability in version 12.1 to support the reporting of â€˜HSâ€™ as the grade level. In order to do that these are the considerations to be aware of.

1. The Assessment needs to be added/modified with HS selected as the Grade Level. If you are updating existing assessments to use â€˜HSâ€™ you would remove the versions of that assessment with Grade Level in 9, 10, 11, or 12. After logging in, from the gear icon, select Toggle. When that page loads select â€˜Assessmentsâ€™ to add or modify State assessment information.

The &#x22;Assessments&#x22; option is highlighted on the left side, where users can add or modify State assessment information."><figcaption><p>To add or modify State assessment information for the new "HS" grade level in version 12.1, navigate to "Settings" and select "Toggle," then click on "Assessments."</p></figcaption></figure>

2. When loading the student assessment data into `Staging.AssessmentResult` for those assessments, set the `GradeLevelWhenAssessed` value as â€˜HSâ€™.
3. Add the following mapping to the `Staging.SourceSystemReferenceData` table to translate the value correctly.

```sql
INSERT INTO Staging.SourceSystemReferenceData
VALUES (2024, 'RefGradeLevel', '000126', 'HS', 'HS');
```

#### Staging Table Update

In Generate v12.1, the field `K12Organization.School_TitleIPartASchoolDesignation` has been renamed to `K12Organization.School_TitleISchoolStatus`. This change may impact any State ETLs that populate `Staging.K12Organization` or any Snapshot processes that reference the `Staging.K12Organization` table. Please review your ETL processes and Snapshot configurations to ensure compatibility with this update.

### Enhancements

#### New Testing Capabilities

In Generate 12.1, we have enhanced our testing processes by expanding unit and file specification testing and integrating with EDPass for a streamlined test environment. This integration allows us to validate submission files, verify upload functionality, and conduct data quality checks prior to submission windows, thereby ensuring the reliability and accuracy of Generateâ€™s file specifications.

2. CIID-2742: FS185 Assess Participation Math & FS189 Assess Participation Science - Filter zero counts by grade and subject that are in app.toggleassessment.

   * Resolved issue in Toggle where the system was incorrectly indicating the changes made by the user were saved.
2. CIID-3958: FS194 Young Homeless Children Served (McKinney-Vento) - Missing 'UNDER3' permitted value on the UI screen. Also, permitted values are not displaying in SEA and LEA Submission File.

3. CIID-3961: FS118 & FS194 Homeless - Migrate\_DimAges and Migrate\_StudentCounts Not Passing in the factTypeCode Properly.
   * Migrate\_StudentCounts and Migrate\_StudentDisciplines have been updated to use the Get\_Ages function instead of Migrate\_DimAges.Passing @factTypeCode into Migrate\_DimAges.
4. CIID-3964: FS118 Homeless - The grade code AGE3TO5NOTK should be 3TO5NOTK.
   * Resolved issue where Generate RDS function-'Get\_CountSQL' – was using the permitted value ‘AGE3TO5NOTK’ instead of ‘3TO5NOTK’.
5. CIID-3966: FS194 Homeless - RDS Migration - Age calculation sproc requires a specific date to calculate age correctly.
   * Migrate\_StudentCounts and Migrate\_StudentDisciplines were updated to use the Get\_Ages function instead of Migrate\_DimAges.Passing @factTypeCode into Migrate\_DimAges.
6. CIID-3986: FS118 Homeless Students Enrolled - calculating using Schools when the report is SEA/LEA only.
   * Resolved issue where Get\_CountSQL was using the school information in the join for an LEA level report. Also, modified the code specific to the joins for 118, and the code that gets the unique set of students, so that a student enrolled at two schools in the same LEA is counted only once.

IDS but showed as Missing in the RDS.

4. CIID-4437 FS009 (and others) Migrate\_StagingToIDS\_K12Enrollment - change inner join to left join on Grade Level.

   * Updated the WHERE clause in Get\_CountSQL to look for Yes, No and Missing values.

   * A line in the dynamic code for FS143 was excluding students that shouldn’t be excluded. Removed CAT\_IdeaInterimRemoval.IdeaInterimRemovalEdFactsCode <> Missing for this file spec.
10. CIID-4478 MERGE statement in Migrate\_DimK12Students fails for students with multiple enrollments with differing student details.
    * Resolved issue where MERGE statement that populates RDS.DimK12Students was failing.
11. CIID-4494: FS005, 007 - Fix the code that sums discipline to check for > 45 days in Get\_CountSQL
    * The summed Discipline records should only include the REMDW events when comparing

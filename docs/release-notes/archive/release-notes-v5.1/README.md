# Release Notes v5.1

## RELEASE OVERVIEW

Generate version 5.1 continues to leverage a new data migration approach first introduced in version 4.2 of Generate in which data are migrated from Staging tables directly to the RDS Fact and Dimension tables. For SEAs using the Generate user interface to migrate data, this new migration method requires no changes to the loading of the staging tables and requires no changes to how you currently migrate data. Please continue to run the ODS Migration, RDS Migration, and Reports Migration to create submission files.&#x20;

For SEAs that use manual migration scripts that reference the individual stored procedure names that are saved locally, and that DO NOT use the wrapper scripts for that file group (Child Count, Discipline, Exiting, Personnel, or Directory), for example (App.Wrapper\_Migrate\_ChildCount\_to\_RDS), you will need to update them to call the wrapper script because the manual migration scripts will no longer be valid. The wrapper script handles the new process, and that is the only change needed.&#x20;

The benefits of this change include:

* Simplifying the steps in the migration process
* Less debugging as data is migrated
* The migrations run faster

### State ETL changes:&#x20;

There was a stored procedure named `Staging.Migrate_Data_Validation` that was used in earlier versions of Generate. We will be implementing a new migration validation procedure, so we removed this deprecated stored procedure. You will just need to verify that your Source to Staging ETL code does not call this stored procedure. If so, remove the call.

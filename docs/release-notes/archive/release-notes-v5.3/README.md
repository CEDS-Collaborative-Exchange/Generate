# Release Notes v5.3&#x20;

### RELEASE OVERVIEW <a href="#id-3.1.1__impact" id="id-3.1.1__impact"></a>

Generate version 5.3 is a minor release that contains fixes/enhancements primarily focused on the spring file submissions. Additionally, there is a new File Comparison utility that automates the loading and comparison of a state submission file to the same file created in Generate. There is also a new schema called ‘Utilities’ to better group some of the helper processes available in Generate. Detailed documentation on how to use the Utilities in Generate will be available in the Generate Implementation Guide.

**State ETL changes: For Directory files, there are several possible ETL changes required by the States**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
1. `Columns LEA_IsReportedFederally` and `School_IsReportedFederally` in `Staging.K12Organization` are now required to be populated with a value of **1** for LEAs and Schools that are to be **reported in FS029**. If a state loads organizations into staging that are not to be **reported in FS029**, these columns can be populated with **0** or **NULL**.
2. There are two new columns in `Staging.K12Organization` that can be used if needed. These columns are `Prior_LEA_Identifier_State` and `Prior_School_Identifier_State`. These are to be populated in instances where the `LEA_Identifier_State` or `School_Identifier_State` have changed from the previous values. If these are not needed, they may be populated as **NULL**.
{% endhint %}

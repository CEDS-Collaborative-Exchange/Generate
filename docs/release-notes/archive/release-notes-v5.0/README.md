# Release Notes v5.0

## Purpose <a href="#purpose" id="purpose"></a>

This document provides a description of the technical enhancements to Generate version 5.0 released in August 2022. The purpose of this document is to communicate the technical updates made to Generate in version 5.0 with up-to-date information about improvements, including new features and reporting enhancements, which have been made to the system with the new software release.

### Upgrade Procedure <a href="#upgrade-procedure" id="upgrade-procedure"></a>

No changes have been made to the Generate upgrade procedure for this release. Follow the standard Generate upgrade process to install version 5.0.

### Compatible Systems <a href="#compatible-systems" id="compatible-systems"></a>

Generate was tested on the following operating systems and browsers:

* **Windows 10 Pro**
* **Google Chrome**, Version 68 0.3440.106 (Official Build) (64-bit) and&#x20;
* **Firefox Quantum** 61.01 (64 bit)

## Release Overview <a href="#release-overview" id="release-overview"></a>

Generate version 5.0 continues to leverage a new data migration approach first introduced in the previous release of Generate in which data are migrated from Staging tables directly to the RDS Fact and Dimension tables. In Generate version 5.0, there were additional files updated to the new migration method including all the IDEA Discipline files (FS005, FS006, FS007, FS088, FS143 and FS144), Personnel files (FS070, FS099 and FS112), and Exiting files (FS009).

For SEAs using the Generate user interface to migrate data, this new migration method requires no changes to the loading of the staging tables and requires no changes to how you currently migrate data. Please continue to run the ODS Migration, RDS Migration, and Reports Migration to create submission files. For SEAs that use manual migration scripts that reference the individual stored procedure names that are saved locally, and that DO NOT use the wrapper scripts for that file group (Child Count, Discipline, Exiting or Personnel), for example (`App.Wrapper_Migrate_ChildCount_to_RDS`), you will need to update them to call the wrapper script because the manual migration scripts will no longer be valid. The wrapper script handles the new process and that is the only change needed.

The benefits of this change include:

* Simplifying the steps in the migration process
* Less debugging as data is migrated
* The migrations run faster

In another effort to simplify the migration process, wrapper scripts were added at the IDS level for all the non-IDEA files specifications. This enhancement means that there is now a single stored procedure that can be selected to migrate every file grouping in Generate at both the IDS and RDS levels. It also means that the options in the IDS and RDS migration screens now match so to migrate Membership for instance, select Staging.Wrapper\_Migrate\_Membership\_to\_IDS for the IDS migration, then select App.Wrapper\_Migrate\_Membership\_to\_RDS for the RDS migration, then migrate the report(s) by file specification number for the Report migration. Also, on the IDS migration screen, the file specifications included in each wrapper script are noted in the Description column to the right to make it easier to know which wrapper needs to be executed for the file(s) being worked on.

Improvements in the deployment process used to perform automated end-to-end testing of Generate have introduced the potential conflict between the configuration files implemented in states. Please backup and

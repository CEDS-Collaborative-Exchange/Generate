The following pages in Generate were updated in this Release:

1. SPP/APR Report pages:
   1. the link to the SPP/APR Collection tool was updated for all SPP/APR report pages. It now goes to the [OSEP SPP/APR Resources](https://osep.grads360.org/%23program/spp-apr-resources) page.

### Known Issues and Limitations <a href="#known-issues-and-limitations" id="known-issues-and-limitations"></a>

#### Issues/Limitations <a href="#issues-limitations" id="issues-limitations"></a>

1. Reports – EDFacts Submission Reports
   1. Report titles for SY 2017-18 (all reports):
      1. Reports begin with “C” not “FS” for SEA, LEA and Schools, and all category sets. For example, C045 should display FS045.
   2. Format Error (all reports)
      1. Columns can’t be resized so permitted values aren’t displayed in full on some of the online reports
      2. In some screen sizes, the drop-downs on the report page overlap, making them unusable.
   3. C032: report isn’t filtered by Exit or Withdrawal Type
   4. C089: Permitted Value of “Home” is displayed as “Homeless” on the online reports
2. Settings - Toggle
   1. IDEA - EXITING Reference Period – error message “End date of reference period cannot be on or before the Start Date”
      1. The system should override the error message when the radio button is set to “Yes.” Currently, users must change the date fields regardless of whether radio button selection is Yes or No. Switching the radio button to "Yes" should override the error message about the date fields below it being the same (e.g., "End date of reference period cannot be on or before the Start Date.")
   2. Radio button functionality needs to be fixed.
      1. Users cannot click on a button to deselect it once they’ve selected it. Selecting then deselecting the same button/option again and changing the value should be allowed.
   3. Add a warning message in the Toggle when changes are made and the user tries to exist without clicking “Save.”
   4. Add Membership Count Date field to Toggle
   5. There are two words in Toggle that are misspelled
3. Settings - Data Store
   1. There isn’t a kill switch to cancel the Migration process. A kill switch is needed.
4. Reports Library
   1. The graph layout needs to be updated for the following reports:
      1. Preschoolers with Disabilities in Educational Environment
      2. School Age with Disabilities in Educational Environment
      3. Proficiency Level of Grade
      4. Participation in Multiple Federal Programs
   2. Exit from Special Education Report:
      1. Add additional information to reports:
         * When Economically Disadvantaged is selected from the Subpopulation dropdown, add a status of "Not Economically Disadvantaged (Not ED)" to the report.
         * When Homeless is selected form the Subpopulation dropdown, add a status of “Not Homeless” to the report
         * When Migrant is selected form the Subpopulation dropdown, add a status of “Not Migrant” to the report
         * Remove “enrolled” from the results and replace with “Homeless Status”
   3. When reports are exported to Excel, the URL to the CEDS Connection should be a link.
5. Link to ED_Facts_ File Specifications goes to SY 2015-16 File Specifications instead of the main File Specification page. The correct link is: [https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/file-](https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/file-specifications.html) [specifications.html](https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/file-specifications.html)

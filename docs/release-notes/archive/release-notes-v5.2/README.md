# Release Notes v5.2

### RELEASE OVERVIEW&#x20;

Generate 5.2 requires some additional steps that must be performed prior to performing the Generate upgrade. Below are the instructions for performing the update.

#### Step 1: **Verify Your Web Environments are Running ASP.NET Core 6.0:**&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
IMPORTANT: Generate 5.2 has been upgraded to ASP.NET Core 6.0. Please verify your web environments are running **ASP.NET Core 6.0** before installing Generate 5.2.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### Step 2: Update Connection Strings:&#x20;

Prior to updating to Generate version 5.2, the state will need to update the connection strings in their **appSettings.json** file in both **\web\config** and **\background**. These files are located on the webserver where Generate was installed.&#x20;

In those files, there is a “Data” parameter that holds the connection string information. Add the following to each connection string, as noted below:&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
NOTE: There may be an additional connection string for`‘StagingDBContextConnection”`. If so, the new parameter needs to be added to that string as well.
{% endhint %}

`"Data": { "AppDbContextConnection": "Server=192.168.01.01; Database=generate; User ID=generate;Password=xxxxxxxxxxx; trustServerCertificate=true; MultipleActiveResultSets=true;", "ODSDbContextConnection": "Server=192.168.01.01; Database=generate; User ID=generate; Password=xxxxxxxxxxx; trustServerCertificate=true; MultipleActiveResultSets=true;", "RDSDbContextConnection": "Server=192.168.01.01; Database=generate; User ID=generate; Password=xxxxxxxxxxx; trustServerCertificate=true; MultipleActiveResultSets=true; Connect Timeout=300;" }`&#x20;

#### Step 3: Perform the Generate Update&#x20;

As for typical Generate updates, backup the Generate database, web files, and background files, then log into the Generate UI and perform the update.

#### State ETL changes:&#x20;

There is a new staging validation process added as part of version 5.2. It is driven by individual rules written to validate common data issues that would impact the results loaded into the final reports. It is a standalone process that does not, in any way, impact how a state currently migrates data for any report. If a state wants to leverage this process, the validation routine can be executed separately after the staging ETL has been successfully executed. The results are stored in a separate table with all the relevant information needed to research those records. A more detailed explanation of the process and how to use it can be found here in the [Generate Staging Validation](https://ciidta.communities.ed.gov/api/ApplicationMedia/GetDownload/109927) document.

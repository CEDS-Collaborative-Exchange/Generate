### Database Updates <a href="#database-updates" id="database-updates"></a>

1. 029 Directory: Updated RDS.Create\_OrganizationReportData to remove filtering of Closed, Inactive, and Future Schools or LEAs. (Reference CIID-3908)
2. 029: Added fields and developed RDS ETL for Mailing Address Line 2 and Physical Address Line 2. (Reference CIID-3914)
3. 029: Resolved issue with reconstituted status. In organization\_encapsulated, the code that populated RefReconstitutedStatusId in ODS.OrganizationFederalAccountability did not qualify the select statement. Staging.Organization has LEA rows that do not have a school ID which caused there to be NULL OrganizationIds in the insert which resulted in an error. This was fixed by adding 'WHERE orgst.SchoolOrganizationId is not null' to the select. (Reference CIID-3889)
4. Cleaned up duplicated calls to functions in Organization\_encapsulated. (Reference CIID-3865)

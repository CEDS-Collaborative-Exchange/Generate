<details>

<summary>‚è≠Ô∏è Once the install is done, what‚Äôs next?</summary>

<summary>‚öíÔ∏è Are there additional tools to assist an SEA in setting up the ETLs for Generate?</summary>

Yes, because Generate is built on CEDS, the CEDS Align and Connect tools provide a location to map your source data systems to CEDS Elements, which will provide details about where data will be stored in Generate. Additionally, all ED_Facts_ reports in Generate have CEDS Connections. The CEDS _myConnect_ tool will show a gap analysis of your source systems against the ED_Facts_ Connection to identify any missing and/or duplicative elements. For more information, please visit [**https://ceds.ed.gov/**](https://ceds.ed.gov/).

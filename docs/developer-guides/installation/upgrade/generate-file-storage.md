# Generate File Storage

**HotFix**

If the current release has any hotfix updates that need to be applied, the files and the instructions for applying them will be found here.

**Metadata Files**

With each release we are supplying the current metadata file pulled from the API.  This file would only need to be used if you are experiencing issues running the metadata process from the Generate application and you need to apply the metadata manually while that issue is being addressed.  Instructions for when that would be necessary and how to do that are located on the Configuring Metadata Updates page located here - [https://center-for-the-integration-of-id.gitbook.io/generate-documentation/developer-guides/installation/configuring-metadata-updates](https://center-for-the-integration-of-id.gitbook.io/generate-documentation/developer-guides/installation/configuring-metadata-updates)

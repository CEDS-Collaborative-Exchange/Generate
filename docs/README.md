# Introduction to Generate

The Center for the Integration of IDEA Data (CIID) developed the Generate application to improve data quality and simplify E&#x44;_&#x46;acts_ reporting for state education agencies (SEAs). Generate standardizes data, improves data use and reporting, and supports administrative and policy work to improve educational outcomes for all students and their families.

**Why use Generate?**

* Automates and simplifies reporting for IDEA E&#x44;_&#x46;acts_ and State Performance Plan/Annual Performance Report (SPP/APR)
* Improves consistency across states for IDEA data
* Supports timely and efficient reporting and submission of E&#x44;_&#x46;acts_ data

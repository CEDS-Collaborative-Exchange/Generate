		This utility will rebuild the Indexes on all of the staging tables.  
		The performance of indexes degrades over time making queries 
		against these tables less efficient.  Rebuilding the index restores
		it to optimal performance.  Occasionally rebuilding indexes is 
		good practice.
		There is a companion utility to this one that will disable the
		indexes called DisableIndexes.

// The file contents for the current environment will overwrite these during build.
// The build system defaults to the dev environment which uses `environment.ts`, but if you do
// `ng build --env=prod` then `environment.prod.ts` will be used instead.
// The list of which env maps to which file can be found in `.angular-cli.json`.

// Use this file for any environment-specific values needed within TypeScript
// If you need environment values that can be modified after deployment, please use /assets/config/config.xxx.json instead

export const environment = {
